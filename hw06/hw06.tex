  \begin{problem}{1}
    \begin{question}
      A manufacturer of pharmaceutical substances has a product line consisting
      of $n$ substances. The substances have completely different properties,
      yet two substances can be distinguished only through sophisticated
      chemical tests. There are $k$ possible chemical tests and, in each test, a
      substance either tests positive or tests negative. The manufacturer wishes
      to assign a product code to each substance. The product code is a binary
      string representing the test outcome for that particular substance. For
      example, if $k=4$, and a substance passes test 1, 3, and 4 but fails test
      2, its code would be 1011.  However, some of the tests are redundant: for
      example, there is no point to encode a test that is passed by all of the
      $n$ available pharmaceutical substances, nor a test whose outcome could be
      inferred by that of another test(s). The manufacturer would like to
      determine if $t<k$ tests are sufficient for the encoding. In other words,
      he needs $t$ out of the $k$ available tests with the property that any two
      of the $n$ substances differ on at least one of the $t$ test outcomes.
      \begin{enumerate}[a.]
      \item Argue that the manufacturer needs at least $t=\Omega(log n)$ tests
        to differentiate the $n$ substances from each other.
      \item Model the manufacturer's problem as an integer linear program.
      \item Use the program to devise a pimal-dual approximation algorithm for
        the manufacturer's problem.
      \item Use the program to devise a randomized approximation algorithm for
        the manufacturer's problem.
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{problem}{2}
    \begin{question}
      The \textit{Bloom filter} is a data structure that is used to represent
      sets in applications that require extreme speed at the potential of a
      small error probability (e.g., packet logging at line speed in
      networks). The Bloom filter uses $k$ hash functions $h_1, h_2, ..., h_k$
      and a binary array $A$ of size $m$. You can assume that $h_i(x)$ is
      equally likely to be any index in the array $A$. Initially, the array $A$
      is 0. An element $x$ is added to set by setting
      $A[h_1(x)], A[h_2(x)], \dots, A[h_k(x)]$ to 1. To check whether $x$
      belongs to the set, the data structure tests whether
      $A[h_1(x)], A[h_2(x)], \dots, A[h_k(x)]$ are all equal to 1: if so, $x$ is
      reported as being in the set, otherwise $x$ is reported as not being in
      the set. Due to potential collisions in the hashing functions, it is
      possible that $x$ is reported as belonging to the set even if it does
      not. However, the data structure is always correct when it reports that
      $x$ does not belong to the set. The data structure does not support
      removal of elements from the set. Assuming that the $n<km/2$ elements have
      been inserted in the Bloom filter, derive a bound on the probability that
      the Bloom filter returns a false positive response.

  \begin{problem}{3}
    \begin{question}
      The \textit{quadratic relaxation} of MAX CUT is:
      \begin{equation*}
        \max \left\{\sum a_{ij} \frac{1 - v_i \cdot v_j}{2}: -e \le v_i \le e\right\},
      \end{equation*}
      where the $v_i$'s are $n$-dimensional vectors, the underlying graph has
      $n$ vertices, and $e$ is the vector of all ones.
      \begin{enumerate}[a.]
      \item Show that, in the optimal solution of this optimization problem,
        every non-zero vector has (at least) a component of value $+1$ or $-1$.
      \item Show that there exists an optimal solution where no vector is zero.
      \item Briefly summarize the main similarities and differences of the
        quadratic and the semi-definite programming relaxations of MAX CUT.
      \item In the next question, you will be using the following general fact
        on vectors and matrixes. Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be two $n$-dimensional
        vectors and define the $2n$-dimensional vector
        \begin{equation*}
          v = \begin{bmatrix*} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix*}
        \end{equation*}
        Define a matrix $H$ such that $v_1 v_2 = v^T H v$.
      \item Write the MAX CUT quadratic relaxation as a \textit{quadratic
          program} of the form $\min\{x^TQx: -e \le x \le e \}$, where $e$ is
        the vector of all ones.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{question}
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}{3}
    \begin{question}
      Implement and solve the MAX CUT quadratic program in octave for a complete
      graph with three vertices, with weights $a_{ij} > 0$ of your choice.
    \end{question}
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}{5}
    \begin{question}
      A sequence of n operations is performed on a data structure.  The $i$th
      operation takes time $i$ if $i$ is a power of 2, and 1
      otherwise. Determine the amortized cost per operation using
      \begin{enumerate}[a.]
      \item Aggregate analysis
      \item The accounting method
      \item A potential function
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{question}
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}{6}
    \begin{question}
      Consider the \textit{Least Frequently Used (LFU)} caching rule, where the
      cached page that has been accessed the least often is the one that is
      evicted when the cache is full and a new page is requested. If there are
      ties, the page that has been in the page the longest is evicted. Show a
      sequence of $n$ requests that forces LFU to miss $\Omega(n)$ times for a
      cache of size $m$, whereas the optimal algorithm will only miss $O(m)$
      times.
